## Getting started

## How we work? 

### Team rituals:

As a team, we have set up a series of tasks that we carry over every day in order to meet the goals agreed on each iteration. In our case, the iterations may last from 1 to 3 weeks depending on the project's complexity. For this case, we decided to have just two iterations of one week each. 

&nbsp;

Each iteration starts with a Planning meeting: The objective of this meeting is to choose the functionalities to implement and clarify the doubts that the project team may have. Likewise, it serves to align the client's expectations with the project teamâ€™s understanding of the project. 

&nbsp;


Daily review meetings: We carry out this kind of meeting from Monday to Friday. Each meeting may last around 20 minutes. The purpose is to focus on what the team accomplished on the previous day, what it will be working on the current day, and discover if any blockers or impediments prevent the team members from progressing in their tasks. 

&nbsp;

We could have other meetings on demand to discuss and find a solution to any technical issues that may appear during the development process.  

&nbsp;

We have created a communication channel dedicated to the project in order to have direct and effective communication between all team members.

&nbsp;


### Planning and estimation

&nbsp;

The team decided to follow an [agile approach](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/practical-fibonacci-beginners-guide-relative-sizing) to estimate the effort to fulfill the project.

&nbsp;

Based on the recommendations provided by Scrum, once the project features were broken down into tasks, the team assigned effort points to each of them. We used the practical Fibonacci approach that is described in the image below.

&nbsp;

Besides that, the team gave each of the effort tags a corresponding amount of hours. 

&nbsp;


| Effort      | Time in hours |            |
| :---        |    :----: |          ---:  |
|                         | Min      | Max |
| No effort is required   | 0        | 1.5 |
| Extra small             | 1.6      | 4   |
| Small                   | 4.1      | 7   |  
| Average                 | 7        | 12  |
| Large                   | 12       | 40  |
